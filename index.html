    <h3><span>Title: </span>Driver Vigilance System using Deep Learning</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>To reduce vehicle accidents and improve transportation safety, a system that can classify 
                                distracted driving is highly desirable .This study is motivated by developing such a distraction
                                detection system that has the potential to be implemented in real vehicles. 
                                Therefore, the goal of this work is to develop an assisteddriving system that can
                                detect distracted driving behaviors and alert the driver to focus on the driving task.
                                Therefore, our project aims to alarm the driver when he/she gets distracted.
                                It mainly focuses on the driver when he/she is using phone or is not wearing the seat 
                                belt or is feeling drowsy.

<h3><span>Title: </span>Online Bus Reservation System</h3>
    <h3><span>Description:Currently, staffs at the ticket counter are using the manual system to sell tickets and manage
                          the bus seat booking. company spends a large cost need to hire a developer to build a system for
                          them. Many people find it hard to contact and go to the bus counter each time they want to find
                          whether there is available ticket on the time they want to depart. It will take quite some time to do
                          the process of finding the available ticket and often involved some cost to do so.
                          Therefore ,our objective is to Manage reservations and seating effectively.
                          • Safe and secure payment gateway module.
                          • Save time spent by standing in queue.
                          • Pay online using online payment facility.
                          • Allow users to reserve seats online.
                          • Participate in Reducing cash transaction to solve the traditional payment problem provide
                            the better work efficiency, security, accuracy, reliability, feasibility.
